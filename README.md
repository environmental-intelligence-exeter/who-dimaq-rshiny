# World Health Organization Air Quality RShiny

## Purpose: Data Integration Model for Air Quality
Estimation of global health risks from exposure to ambient air pollution requires a comprehensive set of air pollution exposure data covering all inhabited areas. The Data Integration Model for Air Quality (DIMAQ) – developed by the University of Exeter – has produced estimates based on data from ground measurements (see the Database on air quality)  together with information from other sources including data from satellite retrievals of aerosol optical depth and chemical transport models. It provides estimates of annual concentrations to PM2.5 at high spatial resolution (0.1° × 0.1°, which equates to approximately 11x11km at the equator) globally.

The sources of data include: Ground measurements from 9690 monitoring locations around the world, satellite remote sensing; population estimates; topography; and information on local monitoring networks and measures of specific contributors of air pollution from chemical transport models. Within DIMAQ, data from these sources are calibrated with ground measurements. The model provides estimates of air quality, expressed in terms of median concentrations of PM2.5, for all regions of the world, including areas in which PM2.5 monitoring is not available
